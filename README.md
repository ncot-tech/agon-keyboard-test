### Agon Light Keyboard Test

This tests the mos_getkbmap() functions from the latest AgDev available from https://github.com/pcawte/AgDev

Also gives some idea how to do various game-like things with the keyboard such as testing if a key is pressed, released or held.

## Old info, no longer relevant

Test for some hacks I made for the Agon Light C Compiler so you can read multiple keyboard keys at the same time.

For this to work you will need the modified AgDev from here that includes the keyboard routines

This is based off my Agon Light AgDev project template from https://github.com/ncot-tech/agon-template
